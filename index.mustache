            <small>
              That's about {{ proportion.count }} out of every

          </h1>

          <p>
            The number of confirmed cases is recently growing at about
            <strong>{{ change_rate.rate }}%</strong> per day. That is doubling
            about every <strong>{{ change_rate.doubling }} days</strong>. At the
            current rate, the total number of confirmed cases will be about
            <strong>{{change_rate.seven_days}}</strong> in 7 days.

            The following chart shows the rate-of-change over time of different
            statistics. The <span class="chart-confirmed">blue line</span> shows
            the rate of change in the total confirmed infections. The
            <span class="chart-tests">orange line</span> shows the rate of
            change in the total number of tests administered. The
            <span class="chart-deaths">black line</span> shows the rate of
            change in the total number of deaths.
